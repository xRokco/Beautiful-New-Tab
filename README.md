# New-Tab
A newtab page for Chrome just for me

If you're cloning this and want the weather integration to work you'll need an OpenWeather API key (you can get a free one from their site).

Put the key in a file called config.js which is in this format
~~~~
var config = {
  owAPI : 'MY_API_KEY_HERE'
}
~~~~
